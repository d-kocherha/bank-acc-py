`print("Hello World!")`

# Welcome to the Primitive Banking Simulator!

While this repo may not be useful for 10x developers and has little to no value for professionals, it's an important first (or second) step on my journey of transitioning into tech.

## Current Features

- User registration;  
- User login;
- Storing user data such as username, ID, and password in a `.json` file (used as a database);
- Created deposit and withdrawal functions (not yet implemented);
- CLI-based `main.py` to interact with the app (now used for tests). 

---

## Tech Stack

- I'm writing this app in the most hyped language (which may or may not be the best idea): **Python**; 
- JSON is used as a database for now;
- Currently learning SQL — future versions might include PostgreSQL;

---

## Goals

- Practice coding;
- Learn to use Git and GitHub;  
- Structure a small project;  
- Fail, learn, fail again, and learn more;  
- Get small dopamine hits when features finally work!

---

## Small Achievements

- Understanding of Python syntax;  
- Deeper understanding of programming logic;  
- Simple refactoring;  
- Using modules;  
- Reading/writing JSON files;  
- Storing and interacting with user data;  
- More to be added (TBU).

---

## TODO

- Let users create savings or checking accounts;  
- Enable deposit and withdrawal functionality;  
- Store transaction history;  
- Provide basic user insights for a better experience.

## How to Use?

At this point, the app is not really usable (from my perspective).  
I'm updating it at my own pace — which has been pretty decent so far, especially in my first month of learning.

## About Me

 - Hello there! I'm Dmytro, almost 30 years old, and I've recently discovered something thrilling in coding. It feels like playing with LEGO — you're building your own "X," and your project is only limited by your real-world resources: time, knowledge, experience, and willingness to learn.
 - In my case, I thought I was somehow broken — I was constantly looking for something new to learn (accounting, guitar, finance, coding). And then I dived deeper into coding and understood that this might be it — there's so much to learn that I probably won't have enough room in my head to absorb it all!
 - Currently, I work at a well-known investment bank and I'm taking my very first steps in tech world (which is nasty fueled by recent lay offs :D ). To bring some structure to my learning, I picked in the Meta Back-End Developer course on Coursera, which has helped me see progress and learn/apply new techniques.
 - The job market is scary, yes — but who knows? Maybe my curiosity and persistence will carry me far enough to land a role in tech someday. This story is still unfolding.

# Thanks for stopping by — and happy coding!!!
